# Building the Unify Matter Protocol Controller

This build guide cross-compiles for arm64 architecture to be run on Unify's
reference platform - a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) with the 64-bit version of Debian
Bullseye.

> **Note:** In the following subsections the commands should either be run on
> your local development machine or inside a running Docker container, as
> distinguished by the structure of the example.
>
> -   _some-command_ should be executed on your local machine.
>     -   _`dev-machine:~$ some-command`_
> -   _some-other-command_ should be executed inside the Docker container.
>     -   _`root@docker:/<dir>$ some-other-command`_


## Check Out Submodules

> ðŸ”´ Assuming you have cloned the unify-matter-pc repo in `~/unify-matter-pc` 

Check out the necessary submodules with the following command.

```bash
dev-machine:~/unify-matter-pc$ ./scripts/build_essentials.sh
```

## Build the Docker Container (arm64 compilation)

```bash
dev-machine:~/unify-matter-pc$ docker build -t unify-matter docker/
```

Start the docker:

```bash
dev-machine:~/unify-matter-pc$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/unify-matter-pc -v ./linux/third_party/UnifySDK:/uic unify-matter
```

If you want to be able to use Zap to generate code from Unify XML files you need
to export UCL_XML_PATH as well.

```bash
root@docker:/uic$ export UCL_XML_PATH=/uic/stage/share/uic/ucl
```

## Activate Matter development environment

Once you have all the necessary submodules, source the Matter environment with the following command. This loads a number of build tools and makes sure the correct toolchains and compilers are used for compiling the Unify Matter Protocol Controller.

Make sure you are in `/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip` directory

```bash
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc$ cd /unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip$ git config --global --add safe.directory /unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip$ git config --global --add safe.directory /unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip/third_party/pigweed/repo
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip$ source ./scripts/activate.sh
```

## Compile the Unify Matter Protocol Controller

Make sure you are in `/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip` directory

```bash
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc$ cd /unify-matter-bridge/linux
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux$ gn gen out/arm64 --args='target_cpu="arm64"'
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux$ ninja -C out/arm64 debian
```

> ðŸ”´ After building, the `unify-matter-pc` binary is located at `/unify-matter-pc/linux/out/arm64/obj/bin/unify-matter-pc`.

## Compile the chip-tool

The `chip-tool` is a CLI tool that can be used to commission the pc and to control end devices.

```bash
root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip$ cd examples/chip-tool

root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip/examples/chip-tool$ gn gen out/arm64 --args='target_cpu="arm64"'

root@docker:/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip/examples/chip-tool$ ninja -C out/arm64
```

> ðŸ”´ After building, the chip-tool binary is located at `/unify-matter-pc/linux/third_party/connectedhomeip/examples/chip-tool/out/arm64/chip-tool`.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is always a good idea for quality software. Documentation on
writing unit tests for the Matter Unify Protocol Controller is in the
[README.md](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/silabs_examples/unify-matter-pc/linux/src/tests/README.md) in the `linux/src/tests` folder.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you do not source the `connectedhomeip/scripts/activate.sh` as described above in
   [Set Up the Matter Build Environment](#set-up-the-matter-build-environment),
   `gn` and other common build tools will not be found.
2. If you do not export the `pkgconfig` for the `aarch64-linux-gnu` toolchain as
   described above in [Build libunify](#build-libunify) you will get errors such
   as `G_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof (unsigned long long) == sizeof (guint64));`
3. If you are compiling unit tests, do not try to compile the Unify Matter
   Protocol Controller at the same time. This will not work as when compiling unit tests you
   are also compiling unit tests for all other sub-components.
4. If you encounter errors linking to `libunify`, try redoing the
   [`libunify` compile steps](#build-libunify).
5. Encountering problems with the submodules can be due to trying to check out
   the submodules inside the docker container.
